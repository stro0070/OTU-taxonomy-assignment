# OTU-taxonomy-assignment
This repository contains a script that compares taxonomies assigned to OTUs by different methods (i.e. AMPtk, Consensus BLAST in QIIME2, etc.), addresses conflicts between different methods, and assigns the deepest (i.e species-level when possible) reliable level of taxonomy to OTUs.
